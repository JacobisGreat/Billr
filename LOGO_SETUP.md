# Logo Setup Instructions

## Save the Logo Image

To complete the logo integration, please save your logo image as:

```
public/images/billr-logo.png
```

## What's Been Updated

I've integrated your beautiful logo into the following areas:

### âœ… **Loading Screens**
- Auth loading screen (when app starts)
- Dashboard loading screen (when loading invoices)
- Both screens now display your logo with elegant animations

### âœ… **Navigation Bar**
- Top navigation in the dashboard now shows your logo
- Hover effects and smooth transitions included

### âœ… **Authentication Forms**
- Login and signup forms now feature your logo
- Maintains the professional, clean aesthetic

### âœ… **Main Loading Page**
- The initial page load screen displays your logo
- Includes drop shadow and smooth transitions

## Fallback System

If the logo image can't be loaded, the system automatically falls back to the text-based "Billr" branding, ensuring your site always looks professional.

## Next Steps

1. Save your logo image to `public/images/billr-logo.png`
2. Refresh your website to see the logo in action
3. The logo will appear throughout the application with beautiful animations and effects

The logo integration maintains all the existing animations and transitions while giving your brand a more professional, polished appearance! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
